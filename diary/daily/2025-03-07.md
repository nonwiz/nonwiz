It's been a while since I post something here, not that there is any worth while to read. I guess it's time for me to get back here and reignite some of my passion back for learning new stuff and writing. 

Recalling the whole 2024 year, I guess the only worthwhile thing I did is participating half marathon event.  Considering I'm not the very active type, in fact, sport is one of things I hate most since kids. (Maybe If I put more effort, I would like it as well.) Not that I hate all types of sports, there few that i like as well (badminton, table tennis). Hopefully in the future i would be able to improve it. I attributed it all being consistent and progress tracking.

Aside from the marathon event, I also started to work on back on my university project. At least finally, I can say the v1 is now done. All I need to do now just to deploy it. The app mainly about purchasing and inventory workflow. Some core features include managing order requests, exporting to pdf in bulk, and later convert it to inventory with some fancy role approving logic and all. 

Previously, I mainly used DecapCMS to do site editing. But now, it kind of a pain somehow. Now instead, I'm moving to obsidian solely, so I can just open on my pc and edit stuff right away.
