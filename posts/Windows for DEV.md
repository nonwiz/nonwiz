I don't usually develop things with windows anymore, mainly just use for gaming purpose. But some tools I like:

- [Komorebi](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi): tiling window manager
- [Yasb](https://github.com/da-rth/yasb): status bar for windows
- [File-pilot](https://filepilot.tech/): better file explorer
